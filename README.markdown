This project will gather all codes written by attendees of the workshop and
will be made private at the end of the workshop.

You will need to clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:gpichot/react-adv-2022-11-02.git
```

And send me your github handle (username) so that I can add you as a
collaborator and allow you to push your code.

If you don not have a github account, you must send me your code by the end of
the workshop as a zip file.

Username or code must be sent to the email address:
[workshop+react-2022-11-02@craftvalue.io](mailto:workshop+react-2022-11-02@craftvalue.io)

# Zipping your code

```
git archive -o latest.zip HEAD
```

# Pushing your code

```
git push
```

# Create your workspace

Create your projects in a subfolder of this directory with your name last name
prefixed by your initials. For example, if your name is
John Doe, your projects will be in the `jdoe` subfolder.

If we do a project with React and another with NextJS, you will have the following
structure:

```
.
├── README.markdown
├── jdoe
│   ├── react
│   └── nextjs
├── gpichot (the correction)
│    ├── react
│    └── nextjs
└── ...other attendees...
    ├── react
    └── nextjs
```
